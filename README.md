A version of rock, paper, scissors using Leap Motion.

Shake hand vertically above controller to count down, (as you would when actually playing).
Make sure when you display your move (rock, paper or scissors) to the sensor your palm is perpendicular to the sensor for most accurate results.
The program will try and beat you, and it will display it's move on screen.
